# BoxnovelToEpub
WIP : Take URL from boxnovel and convert novel to an epub, after scraping

to add: command line argument for novel

issues: only works with select configurations, because of course no one likes standardizing how they should format their chapters

added: 

  → generalization

  → some edge cases handled

  → start and end chapter arguments (yet to add command line or GUI based calls)
